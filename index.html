      <h1>Have you ever wanted to scream?</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">Introducing ScreamGame. This interactive, voice-controlled, screaming game allows two players to compete against each other: one player controls the character in order to avoid the death traps, while the other player voice-activates the death traps.</h5>
      <b>The story:</b>
      <br>
      <p class="w3-text-grey"><i>The player:</i> It’s a nice day outside so you decide to take a walk for the first time in like thirty weeks (because let’s face it, you don’t get out much do you?). Unfortunately all of your suspicions are right: the outside world is trying to kill you. Get out alive so you can live, and more importantly, play more games on your laptop. Also you’re a cute lil’ hamster.</p>
      <p class="w3-text-grey"><i>The environment:</i> Some nerd thought they could just take a walk? False. Try to kill them for lols. Even though they are a cute hamster. But since you aren’t a physical body, you got to scream.</p>
      <b>The gameplay:</b>
      <br>
      <p class="w3-text-grey"><i>The player:</i> Use the arrow keys in order to make the hamster jump, move forward, and move backwards until you reach the goal. Make sure to avoid items that will cause certain death.</p>
      <p class="w3-text-grey"><i>The environment:</i> Scream at the laptop to activate the death traps.</p>

      <h1>Motivation</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">Because why would we do this project, anyways?</h5>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">Our personal motivations, combined with the group motivation of creating a final product of which we were proud and about which we were excited.</p>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">Ultimately, all of us ended up not only engaging with our personal goals, but learning a lot about fields we wanted to explore. Thus, the culmination of this project was not only a success because it was a final product that worked and satisfied the requirements of our lovely Software Design professors, but because we ended up fulfilling our personal motivations.</p>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">This visual shows that the game included many components to help us engage with our personal goals.</p>

      <h1>Implementation</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">Here is an overview of the main parts of our code.</h5>
      <b>Main Part:</b>
      <br>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">Run this! Combines the player and the level for an A+ playing experience.</p>
      <b>Level Editor:</b>
      <br>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">All individual levels are implemented in seperate files, all in one folder. The code specifies which level, which then finds the correct file in the level folder.</p>
      <b>Player:</b>
      <br>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">The player set-up included generating the character, and integrating keyboard commands with character movement.</p>
      <b>Environment:</b>
      <br>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">The environment set-up included generating the sky, the ground, the boxes, and the death-traps.</p>
      <b>Voice Processing:</b>
      <br>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">The game records the character for a small amount of time, and then processes that information to determine whether it was loud enough to make the death traps fall.</p>
      <b>Neural Network:</b>
      <br>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">This trains on the ‘a’, ‘e’, and ‘o’ vowel sounds to differentiate using machine learning methods, specifically a neural network algorithm.</p>
      <b>Physics and Collision Detection Engine:</b>
      <br>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">The physics work off of real life kinematic equations, with the except of the use of trial and error to determine friction and gravity coefficients. The collision detection was fairly basic, as it was two-dimensional and the detection focused on rectangular boxes.</p>
