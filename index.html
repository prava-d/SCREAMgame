      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">Introducing ScreamGame. This interactive, voice-controlled, screaming game allows two players to compete against each other: one player controls the character in order to avoid the death traps, while the other player voice-activates the death traps.</h5>
      <b>The story:</b>
      <br>
      <p class="w3-text-grey"><i>The player:</i> It’s a nice day outside so you decide to take a walk for the first time in like thirty weeks (because let’s face it, you don’t get out much do you?). Unfortunately all of your suspicions are right: the outside world is trying to kill you. Get out alive so you can live, and more importantly, play more games on your laptop. Also you’re a cute lil’ hamster.</p>
      <p class="w3-text-grey"><i>The environment:</i> Some nerd thought they could just take a walk? False. Try to kill them for lols. Even though they are a cute hamster. But since you aren’t a physical body, you got to scream.</p>
      <b>The gameplay:</b>
      <br>
      <p class="w3-text-grey"><i>The player:</i> Use the arrow keys in order to make the hamster jump, move forward, and move backwards until you reach the goal. Make sure to avoid items that will cause certain death.</p>
      <p class="w3-text-grey"><i>The environment:</i> Scream at the laptop to activate the death traps.</p>

      <h1>Implementation</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">Here is an overview of the main parts of our code.</h5>
      <b>Main Part:</b>
      <br>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">Run this! Combines the player and the level for an A+ playing experience.</p>
      <b>Level Editor:</b>
      <br>
      <img src="http://i.imgur.com/nJnO2wX.png" alt="imgur.com">
      <br>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">All individual levels are implemented in seperate files, all in one folder. The code specifies which level, which then finds the correct file in the level folder.</p>
      <b>Player:</b>
      <br>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">The player set-up included generating the character, and integrating keyboard commands with character movement.</p>
      <b>Environment:</b>
      <br>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">The environment set-up included generating the sky, the ground, the boxes, and the death-traps.</p>
      <b>Voice Processing:</b>
      <br>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">The game records the character for a small amount of time, and then processes that information to determine whether it was loud enough to make the death traps fall.</p>
      <b>Neural Network:</b>
      <br>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">This trains on the ‘a’, ‘e’, and ‘o’ vowel sounds to differentiate using machine learning methods, specifically a neural network algorithm.</p>
      <b>Physics and Collision Detection Engine:</b>
      <br>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">The physics work off of real life kinematic equations, with the except of the use of trial and error to determine friction and gravity coefficients. The collision detection was fairly basic, as it was two-dimensional and the detection focused on rectangular boxes.</p>

      <h1>Project History</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">As for actual code building, we built our code starting simple and making it more complex.</h5>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">1 - Got voice input from the laptop and was able to quantify it. A basic level with the environment and a moving player (through keyboard, only could move back and forth) was created.</p>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">2 - The voice input was turned into one amplitude. Collision detection and physics was included in the environment and the game environment. Character can jump and interact with the environment.</p>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">3 - A threshold was set and a calibration period was introduced. Death traps were added.</p>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">4 - Death traps fall based on voice input. The player can die when coming in contact with interactive traps or land traps.</p>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">In terms of idea, our idea changed quite a bit.</h5>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">1 - A three-dimensional game with volume and pitch controlling elevation of the landscape. Volume and pitch also control the path that the player has. The game would be played on separate laptops.</p>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">2 - A three-dimensional game, played on one laptop, with volume and pitch controlling elevation of the landscape but the arrow keys controlling the path of the player.</p>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">3 - A two-dimensional game, played on one laptop, with volume controlling elevation of the landscape and the arrow keys moving the player.</p>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">4 - A two-dimensional game, played on one laptop, with volume controlling death traps that kill a character. The player is controlled by the keyboard.</p>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">5 - A two-dimensional game, played on one laptop, with vowel sounds controlling the type of death trap that kills a character. The player is controlled by the keyboard.</p>

      <h1>Future Steps</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">Although satisfied with the implementation of our vision, we realize there are multiple ways we could carry this project even further.</h5>
      <b>Neural Network:</b>
      <br>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">The neural network is trained on the vowel sounds of ‘a,’ ‘e,’ and ‘o,’ However, more options could be included if it were trained on all the vowel sounds. This would probably require more work on the neural network so that it will be more accurate (or possibly the existing one would be fine). More recognizable vowel sounds means more options in the game. Also, although the neural network theoretically works, Prava fell into the classic training data hubris. This was fine in context of the project and learning goals, but it was still slightly demoralizing.</p>
      <b>Voice Control:</b>
      <br>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">One idea that was discussed was having both elements of the play experience (controlling the player and controlling the environment) be voice-controlled. To do this, the game would have to be hosted on two different laptops (the reason that having the game able to be played across two different laptops wasn’t a significant next step is because we felt that being able to scream and use keyboard commands on one laptop by two people added to the gaming experience).</p>
      <b>Environment Build:</b>
      <br>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">Although the environment is voice-controlled, another option we were considering (and this could go with implementing more vowel sounds) is being able to ‘build’ the environment. As in, when pitch or volume is raised, the environment builds up, and when pitch and volume is lowered, the environment goes deeper.</p>
      <b>Hosted Online:</b>
      <br>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">Using something like Flask, it would be interesting and more convenient if there was a way to host the game on the web instead of making players download a git repository and play it through the terminal window.</p>
